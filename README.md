Login page and registration page is available where students can login and fill 
in the details one wishes to pursue, so that Study portal team will contact them 
and help them choose their desired stream of interest.
Introduction to Web Designing:
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are
two of the fundamental technologies used to create Web pages. HTML provides
the page structure, while CSS provides the (visual and aural) layout for a variety
of devices. HTML and CSS, along with graphics and scripting, form the
foundation of creating Web pages and Web Applications.HTML is a language
used to describe the structure of Web pages.
HTML allows authors to do the following:
Create online documents with headings, text, tables, lists, photos, and so on. At
the click of a button, you can access online information via hypertext links.
Create forms for interacting with remote services, such as searching for
information, making reservations, ordering products, and so on. Spreadsheets,
video clips, sound clips, and other applications should be included directly in
their documents. Authors use markup to describe the structure of pages in
HTML. Language elements label pieces of content such as "paragraph," "list,"
"table," and so on.
Markup languages function similarly to how you labelled those content types,
except they use code to do so – specifically, HTML tags, also known as
"elements." The names of these tags are fairly self-explanatory: header tags,
paragraph tags, image tags, and so on. Every web page is made up of a slew of
HTML tags that represent the various types of content on the page. Each type of
content on the page is "wrapped" in HTML tags, i.e. surrounded by them.
You can use HTML to add headings, format paragraphs, control line breaks,
create lists, emphasise text, insert images, create links, build tables, control
some styling, and much more.
CSS is a design language that you use to make your web page look nice and
presentable, whereas HTML is a markup language used to format/structure a
web page. CSS is an abbreviation for Cascading Style Sheets, and it is used to
improve the appearance of a web page. By including thoughtful CSS styles, you
can make your page more appealing and enjoyable to view and use for the end
user.
A syntax is basically a set of rules that generally consists of a selector, a
property and a value, a CSS syntax contains a selector and a declaration block
CSS can also be used to layout elements by placing them in specific areas of
your page.
To access these elements, you have to “select” them. You can select a single or
multiple web elements and specify how you want them to look or be positioned.
The rules that govern this process are called CSS selectors.
With CSS you can set the colour and background of your elements, as well as
the typeface, margins, spacing, padding and so much more.
Id Selector
To write a hash(#) character, To select an element with a particular Id, followed
by the Id of the element. The id selector is used to select one specific element.
The id of an element is unique within a particular page, it is chosen to select a
single, unique element in a page.
class selector
HTML element is select by class selector with a specific class attribute. Write a
period (.) character, to select element with a specific class followed by the
specific class name.
Universal Selector
It selects all the elements on the pages. To select all the HTML elements on the
page we used universal selector (*).
In CSS there are two types of styles:
External Style:
Commonly used style. Style and html are in separate file. To add an external
stylesheet to a web page, use the <link> tag, providing the URL of the style
sheet in the href attribute, as well as rel="stylesheet” is then linked to from
Since the CSS code is in a separate document, your HTML files will have a
cleaner structure and are smaller in size. You can use the same .css file
for multiple pages.
Inline Style:
This method is useful for testing or previewing the changes, and performing
quick-fixes to your website. You don’t need to create and upload a separate
document as in the external style.

Technologies Used 
XML is a software- and hardware-independent tool for storing and transporting 
data. XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. XML is a markup language 
much like HTML. XML was designed to store and transport data. XML was 
designed to be self-descriptive. XML is a W3C Recommendation.
The XML language has no predefined tags. The tags in the example above (like 
<to> and <from>) are not defined in any XML standard. These tags are "invented" 
by the author of the XML document. HTML works with predefined tags like <p>, 
<h1>, <table>, etc. With XML, the author must define both the tags and the 
document structure.
XML simplifies data sharing. XML simplifies data transport. XML simplifies 
platform changes. XML simplifies data availability. Many computer systems 
contain data in incompatible formats. Exchanging data between incompatible 
systems (or upgraded systems) is a time-consuming task for web developers. Large 
amounts of data must be converted, and incompatible data is often lost.
XML stores data in plain text format. This provides a software- and hardwareindependent way of storing, transporting, and sharing data. XML also makes it 
easier to expand or upgrade to new operating systems, new applications, or new 
browsers, without losing data. With XML, data can be available to all kinds of 
"reading machines" like people, computers, voice machines, news feeds, etc.
XML Schema describes the structure of an XML document, just like a DTD. An 
XML document with correct syntax is called "Well Formed". An XML document 
validated against an XML Schema is both "Well Formed" and "Valid".
XML Schemas are written in XML. XML Schemas are extensible to additions. 
XML Schemas support data types. XML Schemas support namespaces. With XML 
Schema, your XML files can carry a description of its own format. With XML 
Schema, independent groups of people can agree on a standard for interchanging 
data. With XML Schema, you can verify data.
One of the greatest strengths of XML Schemas is the support for data types: It is 
easier to describe document content. It is easier to define restrictions on data. It is 
easier to validate the correctness of data. It is easier to convert data between different 
data types. 
Another great strength about XML Schemas is that they are written in XML: You 
don't have to learn a new language. You can use your XML editor to edit your 
Schema files. You can use your XML parser to parse your Schema files. You can 
manipulate your Schemas with the XML DOM. You can transform your Schemas 
with XSLT
XSLT can transform an XML document into HTML. XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet 
Language Transformations) is the recommended style sheet language for XML. 
XSLT is far more sophisticated than CSS. With XSLT you can add/remove elements 
and attributes to or from the output file. You can also rearrange and sort elements, 
perform tests and make decisions about which elements to hide and display, and a 
lot more. XSLT uses XPath to find information in an XML document.
In case of HTML document, tags are predefined such as table, div, and span; and 
the browser knows how to add style to them and display those using CSS styles. But 
in case of XML documents, tags are not predefined. In order to understand and style 
an XML document, World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) developed XSL which 
can act as XML based Stylesheet Language. An XSL document specifies how a 
browser should render an XML document.
An XSLT stylesheet is used to define the transformation rules to be applied on the 
target XML document. XSLT stylesheet is written in XML format. XSLT Processor 
takes the XSLT stylesheet and applies the transformation rules on the target XML 
document and then it generates a formatted document in the form of XML, HTML, 
or text format. This formatted document is then utilized by XSLT formatter to 
generate the actual output which is to be displayed to the end-user.
JSON or JavaScript Object Notation is a lightweight text-based open standard 
designed for human-readable data interchang. The official Internet media type for 
JSON is application/json. The JSON filename extension is .json.
JSON is used while writing JavaScript based applications that includes browser 
extensions and websites. JSON format is used for serializing and transmitting 
structured data over network connection. It is primarily used to transmit data 
between a server and web applications. Web services and APIs use JSON format to 
provide public data. It can be used with modern programming languages. JSON is 
easy to read and write. It is a lightweight text-based interchange format. JSON is 
language independent.
JSON and XML are human readable formats and are language independent. They 
both have support for creation, reading and decoding in real world situations. XML 
is more verbose than JSON, so it is faster to write JSON for programmers. XML is 
used to describe the structured data, which doesn't include arrays whereas JSON 
include arrays.
JavaScript's eval method parses JSON. When applied to JSON, eval returns the 
described object.
AngularJS is a very powerful JavaScript Framework. It is used in Single Page 
Application (SPA) projects. It extends HTML DOM with additional attributes and 
makes it more responsive to user actions. AngularJS is open source, completely free, 
and used by thousands of developers around the world. It is licensed under the 
Apache license version 2.0.
AngularJS is an open-source web application framework. AngularJS is a efficient 
framework that can create Rich Internet Applications (RIA). AngularJS provides 
developers an options to write client side applications using JavaScript in a clean 
Model View Controller (MVC) way. Applications written in AngularJS are crossbrowser compliant. AngularJS automatically handles JavaScript code suitable for 
each browser. AngularJS is open source, completely free, and used by thousands of 
developers around the world. It is licensed under the Apache license version 2.0. 
Overall, AngularJS is a framework to build large scale, high-performance, and 
easyto-maintain web applications.
Node.js is an open-source server environment. Node.js is free. Node.js runs on 
various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.). Node.js uses
JavaScript on the server. Node.js can generate dynamic page content. Node.js can 
create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server. Node.js can collect 
form data. Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database. Node.js files 
contain tasks that will be executed on certain events. A typical event is someone 
trying to access a port on the server. Node.js files must be initiated on the server 
before having any effect. Node.js files have extension ".js"
Express is a fast, assertive, essential and moderate web framework of Node.js. You 
can assume express as a layer built on the top of the Node.js that helps manage a 
server and routes. It provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile 
applications. Let's see some of the core features of Express framework: It can be 
used to design single-page, multi-page and hybrid web applications. It allows to 
setup middlewares to respond to HTTP Requests. It defines a routing table which is 
used to perform different actions based on HTTP method and URL. It allows to 
dynamically render HTML Pages based on passing arguments to templates.
MongoDB is a cross-platform, document oriented database that provides, high 
performance, high availability, and easy scalability. MongoDB works on concept of 
collection and document. Database is a physical container for collections. Each 
database gets its own set of files on the file system. A single MongoDB server 
typically has multiple databases. Collection is a group of MongoDB documents. It 
is the equivalent of an RDBMS table. A collection exists within a single database. 
Collections do not enforce a schema. Documents within a collection can have 
different fields. Typically, all documents in a collection are of similar or related 
purpose.
